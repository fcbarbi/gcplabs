# Welcome to GCP Labs!

This is my list of Machine Learning (ML) labs run in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
GCP makes it easy and affordable to analyse huge datasets. 

* Colab Jupyter notebooks access GCP resources, datasets and analysis tools
* Times series analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in Tensorflow  
* Recommendation systems using Tensorflow and DSSM (Deep Structural Semantic Models)

For each lab, we present the theory background and mingle it with applications acessing datasets stored on Cloud Storage.

Colab integration with GDrive.
