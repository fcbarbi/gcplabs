# Welcome to GCP Labs!

This is my list of Machine Learning (ML) labs in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
GCP makes it easier and affordable to analyse huge datasets and intergrate this with GDrive.

* Key concepts in ML
* Jupyter notebooks on Colab to access GCP resources (stored data and analysis tools)
* Tensorflow for Recurrent Neural Networks for times series analysis 
* Recommendation system using Tensorflow and DSSM (Deep Structural Semantic Models)
